  <h1>TOKYO Rails Meetup</h1>

  <p>The TOKYO Rails Meetup Group is for web engineers who are using, or are interested in learning more about the Ruby on Rails framework.
  </p>
  <p>
  We want to encourage all Rubyists and Railers to join us on the first Thursday of every month for good food, drinks and conversation at the COOKPAD offices in Shirokanedai, Tokyo.
  </p>
  <p>The events are free and open to all who register, and we particularly want to encourage both Japanese and English speakers to come and join in.
